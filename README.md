### **## 🛠️ Methodology**

- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
- Visualization of ETF and price of Bitcoin
- Correlation and pattern analysis

### ➡️**What i have done:**

I analyzed the relationship between Bitcoin prices and BTC ETFs using Python, collecting and cleaning historical data, applying statistical methods, and building charts to explore trends and correlations.

### ➡️**What value i have delivered:**

I provided insights into how BTC ETFs move relative to Bitcoin, highlighted key patterns to inform investment decisions, and translated complex data into clear charts for stakeholders.

  ### ##📌 **Takeaways**

The BTC Index built from ETF data showed a moderate correlation with actual Bitcoin prices, with around 60% accuracy. This suggests ****ETF activity can be one of the indicators for investors to monitor — but it should not be solely relied on for predicting price movement.
